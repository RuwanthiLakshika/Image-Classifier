# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project demonstrates the creation of an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a comprehensive classifier capable of accurately identifying and classifying various objects or patterns. To achieve this, use TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.
